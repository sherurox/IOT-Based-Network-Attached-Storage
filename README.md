## üìå Installation Guide

### **Step 1: Install Raspberry Pi OS**
1. **Download** the latest Raspberry Pi OS from the [official website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/).
2. **Format** the microSD card using [SD Card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/).
3. **Flash** the OS image using [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).
4. **Insert** the microSD into the Raspberry Pi 4 and **power** it on.
5. **Optional**: Set up SSH headlessly by placing an empty `ssh` file in the `/boot` partition.  

---

### **Step 2: Install OpenMediaVault via Script**
1. **Open a terminal** on the Raspberry Pi (via SSH or locally).
2. **Run** this command to download and execute the OMV installation script:
   ```bash
   wget -O - https://github.com/OpenMediaVault-Plugin-Developers/installScript/raw/master/install \
   | sudo bash
3. Wait for the installation to complete (it may take several minutes).
4. The system will reboot automatically once done.

---

### **Step 3: Access OMV Web Interface**
1. Find the IP address of your Raspberry Pi (e.g., via ifconfig or your router‚Äôs DHCP list).
2. Open a browser on a PC or laptop on the same network.
3. Navigate to http://<RaspberryPi_IP_Address>/.
4. Log in using default credentials: <br>
Username: admin<br>
Password: admin<br>
5. Immediately change the default admin password under System > General Settings for security.

---

### **Step 4: Configure Storage in OMV**
1. Connect your external drives (HDD, SSD, USB, etc.) via USB.
2. In the OMV UI, go to Storage > Disks.
3. Select each disk and click ‚ÄúWipe‚Äù if needed (erases existing data).
4. Create a File System: <br>
Navigate to Storage > File Systems.<br>
Click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù, select the disk, and choose a file system type (e.g., ext4).<br>
5. Mount the file system:<br>
After creation, select it and click ‚ÄúMount‚Äù.<br>
Click ‚ÄúApply‚Äù to confirm changes.<br>

### **Step 5: Create Shared Folders**
1. In OMV, go to Storage > Shared Folders.
2. Click ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù.
3. Provide: <br>
A Name (e.g., Data, HDD1, etc.).<br>
A Path (auto-generated if you prefer).<br>
The File System you created in Step 4.<br>
4. Set Permissions (e.g., Read/Write for admin, etc.).
5. Repeat for each storage device (HDD, SSD, USB).

---

### **Step 6: Allocate Storage Space**
(Advanced Users Only)

By default, the entire disk space is available under each mounted file system.<br>
If you need precise control (quotas, partial allocations), you can configure:<br>
LVM (Logical Volume Manager) for more flexible partitioning.<br>
Quotas via Storage > File Systems > Quota in OMV to limit user space<br>

---

### **Step 7: Set Up Network Shares**
1. Enable SMB/CIFS:<br>
Go to Services > SMB/CIFS.<br>
Click ‚ÄúEnable‚Äù and ‚ÄúSave‚Äù.<br>
Adjust settings as required (workgroup name, etc.).<br>
2. Add SMB Shares:<br>
Under Services > SMB/CIFS > Shares, click ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù.<br>
Select the Shared Folder created in Step 5.<br>
Adjust permissions and enable ‚ÄúPublic‚Äù if you want open access on your LAN.<br>
3. Apply Config: Confirm and apply changes.<br>
4. Access from Other Devices:<br>
Windows: \\<RaspberryPi_IP_Address><br>
macOS/Linux: smb://<RaspberryPi_IP_Address>/<br>
5. (Optional): You can also configure FTP, NFS, or AFP if you have specific use cases.<br>

## üìä Performance Evaluation

### **Speed Tests**
We tested the NAS setup by transferring a `1.2 GB .mkv` file and other sample data. Below are **observed vs. theoretical** speeds:

| **Storage Type**  | **Observed Speed (MBps)** | **Theoretical Speed (MBps)** |
|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **8 GB SD Card**  | 9 - 12                   | 50 - 70                      |
| **32 GB Pen Drive** | 10 - 15                  | 50 - 70                      |
| **1 TB HDD**      | 100 - 150                | 150 - 200                    |
| **480 GB SSD**    | 300 - 400                | 500 - 550                    |

#### **Key Observations**
1. **SSD outperforms HDD and USB drives** in both read/write speeds.
2. **Ethernet** improves transfer stability compared to Wi-Fi.
3. **Compression & Deduplication** can reduce storage usage and improve speeds.
4. **Integrated File Manager** (network-based) streamlines file access for users.

### **Mobile App Integration**
- An **iOS and Android** application can also be configured (using **SMB/CIFS** or specialized apps like **VNC**, **SSH**, or a custom front-end) to access the NAS on the go.

## üîê Security Measures
1. **Encryption**: Configure **AES-based** or **TLS** encryption for data at rest and in transit.
2. **Authentication**: Use **role-based** accounts and **strong passwords**.
3. **SSH**: Secure Shell access for admin tasks; disable root login if possible.
4. **Backup & Redundancy**:
   - Replicate data across multiple drives or off-site to **prevent single-point failures**.
5. **Compliance**: Align with **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, or IoT-specific privacy policies as needed.

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
1. **Edge Computing**: Process data locally to reduce latency for real-time IoT apps.
2. **AI-Based Predictive Storage**: Employ ML algorithms to optimize resource usage.
3. **Blockchain Security**: Integrate immutable ledgers to enhance data integrity.
4. **Advanced Remote Access**: Seamless multi-site replication and cloud integration.
